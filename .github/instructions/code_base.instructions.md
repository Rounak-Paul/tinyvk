c++ without modern features, no comments in code, do not put not implemented code, class names PascalCase, function names snake_case, variables in snake_case, private variables _snake_case, performance first, cpu cache hit first, no smart pointers, no std::vector, use Quasar::DynamicArray where needed, follow the existing code style, vendor folder is for submodules, do not change any file inside submodules, no legacy compatibility, all refactors must be complete and through, no partial implementations, no duplicate logic, code should not look like AI generated.
